# Getting started with Victory

Victory is an opinionated, but fully overridable, ecosystem of composable React components for building interactive data visualizations.

## Including components

Components can be included individually:

```playground
// import { VictoryPie } from "victory"
<VictoryPie/>
```

Or imported as a set:
```playground
// import * as V from "victory"
<V.VictoryPie/>
```
