Contributing
============

Thanks for helping out!

## Development

Run `npm run demo` to run a webpack dev server with component examples.

## Checks, Tests

Run `npm run check` before committing.

## Dist

Please do not commit changes to files in `dist`.
These files are only committed when we tag releases.

## Generator Compatibility 

All boilerplate components should be named `victory-label` or 
`VictoryLabel` as appropriate.

`src/components/victory-label.jsx` and 
`test/client/spec/components/victory-label.spec.jsx` SHOULD NOT be moved or renamed
