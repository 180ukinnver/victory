VictoryPie
=============

`VictoryPie` draws an SVG pie or donut chart with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). Styles and data can be customized by passing in your own values as properties to the component. Data changes are animated with [victory-animation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-animation).
