Victory
=======
Victory is an opinionated set of data visualization tools built in React and based on d3. Victory relies on d3 for everything d3 does best, and lets React handle *all* the rendering. Victory's API is built around sensible defaults that make it easy to get started.

## Components

[VictoryLine](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-line)

[VictoryPie](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-pie)

[VictoryTree](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-tree)

[VictoryTreemap](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-treemap)

[VictoryScatter](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-scatter)

[VictoryAxis](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-axis)

## Animation
  Wrap any Victory component with [VictoryAnimation](http://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-animation), and it will transition smoothly between states whenever data changes.  VictoryAnimation relies on d3's interpolator, so it knows how to transitions between colors, dates, numbers, strings etc.

## Themes
    COMING SOON: define a style guide, and wrap components for consistent, custom styling with [Radium](http://github.com/formidablelabs/radium)

## Coming Soon

    - VictoryChord
    - VictoryChart (line, scatter, area, bar etc.)
    - VictoryLegend
